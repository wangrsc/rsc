RSC
======

RSC (for Randomly Spherically Constrained single particle cryo-EM) is a stand-alone computer program for vesicle subtraction. It is developed in the
research group of Liguo Wang at both University of Washington and Yale University. It was originally written in Matlab, and was rewritten in Python for distribution.  

The underlying theory of RSC method is given in a scientific publication (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19718020). If RSC is useful in your work, please cite this paper.
